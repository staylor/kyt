# Migration Guide 0.6 - 0.7

## Prettier

The biggest feature in this release is the addition of Prettier. You can read more about the plugin [here](https://github.com/prettier/prettier). Basically, Prettier auto-formats your code. It should work against kyt's ESLint configuration.

To update your project, use the `prettier-eslint` cli.

```
node_modules/.bin/prettier-eslint src/**/*.js --write
```

That should format all of the scripts in your src directory. To keep things formatted as you develop, install an editor package. See more [here](/docs/Recipes.md#editor-configuration).

## ESLint updates

Most of the ESLint plugins were updated. You can find the details [here](/packages/eslint-config-kyt/README.md#changelog). The upgrade should be seamless if you use Prettier.
